# Transibot

FB Messenger Bot that tells users when their next bus will arrive.

How it works:

1. User sends their location in FB Messenger
2. Transibot asks them to choose which stop they want (
3. Transibot shows the times of the next few buses for the routes serving that stop, along with a map showing where those buses are.
